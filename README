I worked in a deep tech engineering startup i.e PiezoRobotics, in Block 73, One-North, Singapore (one of the startup hubs in Singapore),
where I worked as an Electronics Design Engineer for piezoelectric sensors development for active mechanical vibration control.
All my work (including technical documentation) are stated here for your reference. Please note that I am unable to upload all my 
Arduino and MATLAB codes so I've made a technical documentation report file here which states my workings in an easy to read format to achieve
the necessary technical outcomes, and put in my solutions there with key tools used. 

All projects that I worked on:
1. AC-AC Amplifier Circuit Design
2. Arduino-MATLAB Serial Communication Using Graphical User Interface (GUI)
3. Charge Amplifier Circuit Design for all sensor applications for PuezoRobotics 

Areas Of Expertise Developed:

• PCB Design
• LTSpice
• MATLAB Programming
• EAGLE CAD
• Electronic Circuit Simulation
• ADC-DAC Converters
• Arduino
